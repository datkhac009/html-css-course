                        most sophisticated audience
                        <br> of the capital <br> and its guests for over 6 years.</p>

                        The KODO restaurant appeared in the fall of <br> 2016 on the territory of the Moscow cinema complex and has been serving the most <br> sophisticated audience of the capital ever since. KODO was created <br> by <span id="red">Oleg Krymasov</span>,
                        who designed the <br> space and made most of the <br> recipes. <br><br> The start for KODO was the Moscow Gastronomic Festival in 2016, <br> where the restaurant received the <span id="red">Grand Prix and the title of Bestseller</span><br>                        - more than 3,000 sets were sold in one month, which is an absolute <br> record for 10 years of the festival's existence. In 2019, KODO <br> triumphantly repeated its success, once again becoming the winner <br> of this festival.
                        <br><br> The Kodo Toshishito restaurant on Novorizhskoye Shosse was <br> opened in the fall of 2020 and is the first in a small chain of <br> restaurants offering a completely new level of delivery and to go <br> service. The "little
                        brother" KODO is less prudish and campy, and is a <br> classic Japanese izakaya with huge aquariums and a Japanese <br> robata grill.
